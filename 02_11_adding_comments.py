# adding comments to two of the programs I've written. 

name= "Peter Gonzalez"
print(name.upper())
print(name.lower())
print (name.title()) 

''' 
this one was interesting to write because it is supposed to display the name in three different ways or formats. 
'''

first_name= 'Walt'
last_name= 'Disney'
full_name= f"{first_name} {last_name}"

message= f"{full_name.title()} once said, 'if you can dream it, you can do it.'" 
print (message)

'''
this one was a bit complex compared to the others because I had to create the "full_name" variable 
to display the first and last name together through a message variable.
